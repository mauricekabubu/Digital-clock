# Digital Clock

## Overview
This is a **Digital Clock** application built using **Python**.  
It displays the current time in a simple and easy-to-read format using a **GUI** created with **Tkinter**.  

The project was designed for **beginner Python practice**, focusing on GUI development and working with real-time data.

## Features

- Displays **current time** in hours, minutes, and seconds  
- Updates every second to show the **real-time clock**  
- Simple and user-friendly **Tkinter GUI**  
- Beginner-friendly and easy to understand  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python** – Programming language  
- **Tkinter** – GUI library for Python  
- **datetime** – Python library to get current time  

---

## Goal of the Project

The main goals of this project were:

1. Learn **Python GUI development** with Tkinter  
2. Work with the **datetime module** to get and update the current time  
3. Understand **real-time updates** in Python applications  
4. Practice **structuring a small Python project**

## What I Learned

During this project, I learned:

- How to create **windows, labels, and layouts** using Tkinter  
- How to use **datetime** to get current system time  
- How to **update GUI elements dynamically**  
- How to structure Python code for GUI projects  
- Basic debugging and user interface design

## Future Improvements

- Add **date display** along with the time  
- Allow **custom time formats** (12-hour or 24-hour)  
- Add **alarm or timer functionality**  
- Customize **GUI styling** with colors and fonts
